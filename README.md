## About The Project


**M1PP Launcher** is a custom launcher designed to simplify the process of setting up and playing osu! on the [M1PP](https://m1pposu.dev/) and [4ayo](https://4ayosu.ovh/) private servers.

It automates osu! installation, server configuration, and launching—all wrapped in a user-friendly interface.

Currently built only for **Windows**, with broader platform support planned for the future.

In addition to core setup features, the launcher includes **a manager for community-created mods**, making it easy to toggle and manage gameplay mods without editing files or launching injectors manually.
